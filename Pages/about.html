</head><h1>Welcome to Brian's 'About Me' page!</h1>
<p> Brian Uceta (I don't know why I'm speaking in third person, go along with it)
is an aspiring actor, philanthropist and political activist.
He's been born and raised within Washington Heights, Manhattan for 
the past 15 years of his life. He began his acting career in 
freshman year of high school when he was casted in Aladdin Jr.
He was also casted as Seaweed within Hairspray Jr. a year later. 
Activism is very serious to him, he raised $5000 for a domestic
violence prevention organization named 'VIP Mujeres', and also 
gained $1000 for his school thanks to the Think it Up program.
He's been in multiple anti-Trump protests and is also wishing to be 
a public speaker once he's more well known, motivating students
and people around the world to aspire for the dreams they wish for.</p>
